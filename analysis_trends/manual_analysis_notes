Key Insights from the Data:

1. Strong Scent Preferences & Demand for Retired Products
	•	Multiple users expressed love for specific scents:
	•	Coconut Lime, Vanilla, Tangerine, and Orange Creamsicle are well received.
	•	One highly specific request was to “bring back Pink Champagne,” signaling nostalgic demand for discontinued scents.
	•	Negative callout: Electric Beach was directly labeled “trash,” indicating at least one polarizing scent.
Action: Use comment sentiment to guide scent retirements, relaunch popular legacy scents, or test scents regionally before full scale.


2. Retail Availability Gaps & Geography-Specific Demand
	•	Several users asked where to find the products (“Where I stores?”) or declared they couldn’t get them in their country, such as:
	•	“Please carry these in Canada! I miss them so much!”
Action: Improve store locator tools, expand shipping to underserved markets like Canada, and communicate availability more clearly in posts.


3. Contest Strategy May Alienate Loyal Followers
	•	A user expressed frustration with Instagram-only giveaways, noting:
	•	“There are loyal customers on this platform as well.”
Action: Broaden campaign eligibility across channels (e.g., include Facebook, email subscribers), especially for long-time brand advocates not active on Instagram.


4. Cross-Product & Collection-Level Enthusiasm
	•	High engagement around the Tangerine Collection Giveaway, with multiple tags and emojis showing excitement.
	•	People use multiple products at once (e.g., “Why use one scrub when you can use them all at once”).
Action: Bundle complete routine sets (scrub, pre-shave, oil, lotion), especially for popular lines like Tangerine.


5. Strong Early and Repeat Purchase Signals
	•	Comments like:
	•	"Just finally tried the scrub and I love it."
	•	"I just got the scrub and I love it. I will be getting more."
These indicate strong post-purchase enthusiasm that could be harnessed in triggered review requests or cross-sell automation.
Action: Activate loyalty workflows (e.g., email/text follow-ups with upsells or review incentives after purchases).

6. User-Generated Creativity & Emotional Connection
	•	Users treat product usage as playful and personal:
	•	One comment suggests they already mix products: "xsBeen doing this for a while.""
	•	Another said: "Like rainbow 🌈" in reaction to using multiple scrubs.
Action: Encourage UGC campaigns around "franken-scrub" creations or "multi-scrub rituals." Add branded hashtags or spotlight fans' routines.


7. Product Performance Words Matter
	•	Repetitive affirmation around smell and skin softness, e.g.:
	•	“They all smell delightful 😍”
	•	“LOVE Tree Hut💖”
	•	"Soft skin, soft life 🩷🌸🫧"
One user, however, warned “Wasteful!” in response to a post about using multiple scrubs at once—hinting at sustainability concerns.
Action: Balance sensory marketing with messaging on responsible usage and recyclable packaging. Consider eco-conscious limited editions.
